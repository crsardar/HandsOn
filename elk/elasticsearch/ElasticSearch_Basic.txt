ElasticSearch 6.5

>>>
Default Characteristic :
	
	Primary Shards/Index = 5
	
	Replica/Shard = 1
	
	[means - if cluster has min 2 nodes, a index will have 5 primary shards and another 5 replica shards
	(1 complete replica) for a total of 10 shards per index]

	Dynamically change the number of shards for an existing index using the '_shrink' and '_split' APIs.
	
	cluster.name = elasticsearch
	
	node.name = the first seven characters of the randomly generated UUID. 
				Note that the node id is persisted and does not change when a node restarts 
				and therefore the default node name will also not change.

Important Directory and File :

Change Config Files Locations :
	
	'/etc/default/elasticsearch' in that change the valeu of 'ES_PATH_CONF'
	
	
>>>
Cluster Health :
	
	Health == green, yellow or red. 
	On the shard level - 
		Red = specific shard is not allocated in the cluster. 
		Yellow = the primary shard is allocated but replicas are not. 
		Green = all shards are allocated.
		
	The index level status is controlled by the worst shard status. 
	The cluster status is controlled by the worst index status.
